This project was created during my training. I developed it using Node.js, Express, and the Twig template engine. The site's purpose is to showcase my work, skills, and experience. It features a typewriter-style animation and presents my CV in a style inspired by Visual Studio Code. Additionally, I have temporarily disabled the email sending function.
